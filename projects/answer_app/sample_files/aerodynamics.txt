Boundary layer control, achieved using suction or blowing methods, can significantly reduce the aerodynamic drag on an aircraft's wing surface. The yaw angle of an aircraft, indicative of its side-to-side motion, is crucial for stability and is controlled primarily by the rudder. By adjusting the rudder, pilots can influence the aircraft's horizontal orientation and ensure that it stays on course. Effective yaw control is essential for maintaining coordinated flight, especially during turns or in crosswind conditions, where unbalanced yaw could lead to adverse yaw or sideslip, compromising the aircraft's aerodynamic efficiency and safety.
