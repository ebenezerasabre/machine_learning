Hereâ€™s the log text presented as a paragraph:

The server started on port 3000, and a database connection was established. A user login request was received from IP: 192.168.1.101, but an invalid login attempt occurred for user "john_doe." Shortly after, a database query timeout happened for request ID 12456. A new record was created in the 'users' collection with ID 605c91, followed by data being fetched from the cache for session ID ABC123. A file, "report_2024.pdf," was uploaded successfully, though another upload attempt failed for user "jane_doe." A warning indicated high memory usage at 85%. User "admin" logged out, and the cache for session ABC123 was invalidated. A backup process was initiated and completed successfully, but a connection to the external Payment Gateway service was lost. The system attempted to reconnect to the Payment Gateway shortly afterward.
