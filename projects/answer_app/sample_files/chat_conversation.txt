MongoDB is a NoSQL, document-oriented database designed to store, retrieve, and manage data in a flexible, schema-less format. Instead of using tables and rows like traditional relational databases, MongoDB uses collections and documents. Each document is stored in BSON (Binary JSON) format, which allows for nested data structures and dynamic schemas. This flexibility means that documents in the same collection can have different fields and data types, making it easy to handle unstructured or semi-structured data. MongoDB supports powerful querying, indexing, and aggregation features, and it scales horizontally by distributing data across multiple servers for high availability and load balancing.
